# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis and Sustainable Solutions for India

This repository contains the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from different vehicle types in India, focusing on identifying major contributors and proposing sustainable solutions. The project utilizes **MongoDB**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **PowerBI** for data analysis and visualization.

> **Note:** Due to the confidential nature of the project, no source files or datasets will be shared in this repository.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to analyze greenhouse gas emissions in India, particularly from road transport, and identify the major contributors. Based on this analysis, we proposed sustainable solutions, such as the implementation of **eHighway technology** to reduce emissions.

### Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Collected emissions data from various vehicle types across different cities and highways in India. The data was stored and processed using **MongoDB** to leverage its aggregation capabilities for complex queries.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - **Seaborn** and **Plotly** were used for creating visualizations to understand trends and relationships in the data.
  - Univariate and bivariate analyses helped identify key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, including specific cities and highways emitting the most gases over time.

- **Dashboard Creation**:
  - Used **PowerBI** to create interactive dashboards that showcased emissions trends across different regions and vehicle types.
  - The dashboards provided insights into the distribution of emissions across cities like **Chennai**, **Bangalore**, **Delhi**, and **Mumbai**. The highest contributors to emissions were identified, allowing for targeted interventions.

### Maps and Data Visualization

The **PowerBI** dashboards also included geographical maps displaying the distribution of emissions across metropolitan areas in India:
- **City-wise Emissions**: Visualized emissions in terms of **CO2**, **SO2**, **NOx**, **PM**, and other pollutants across cities like **Chennai**, **Delhi**, **Bangalore**, and **Mumbai**.
- **Vehicle Emissions**: Emissions breakdown by vehicle types, such as **two-wheelers**, **trucks**, **buses**, and **cars**, highlighting that trucks and buses were the major contributors.

### Sustainable Solution Proposal

Based on the analysis, a proposal was developed to implement **eHighway technology** in India's busiest corridors. This solution aimed to reduce emissions by electrifying major roadways and integrating electric vehicles into public transport systems.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: Used for data storage and performing aggregate queries to group emissions data by city, vehicle type, and time.
- **Seaborn & Plotly**: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), focusing on the relationship between emissions and vehicle types across different regions.
- **PowerBI**: To create interactive dashboards that visualized key trends and provided actionable insights into emissions data.
- **Faker**: Used for generating realistic synthetic data for some scenarios.
- **Mockaroo**: For bulk data generation and population in certain aspects of the project.

## Results and Insights

- **Major Contributors**: Trucks and buses were identified as the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.
- **City Emissions**: Cities like **Chennai**, **Bangalore**, and **Delhi** had the highest emissions, particularly along major highways.
- **Sustainable Solution**: Proposed the integration of **eHighway technology** as a key intervention to reduce emissions in high-traffic corridors.

## Future Directions

- Expanding the dataset to include real-time emissions monitoring.
- Implementing the proposed **eHighway technology** in a pilot project for evaluation.
- Extending the analysis to other sectors contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, such as industrial pollution.
